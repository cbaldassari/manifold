# Group detection in energy commodity markets through manifold-informed Wasserstein barycenter

by
Cristiano Baldassari,
Carlo Mari.

This repository contains the code to reproduce all the results reported in the paper Group detection in energy commodity markets through manifold-informed Wasserstein barycenter.


## Reproducing the results

This repo provides the Python notebooks [step 1](https://github.com/cbaldassari/manifold/blob/main/manifold-informed-wasserstein-barycenter.ipynb), [step 2](https://github.com/cbaldassari/manifold/blob/main/manifold-informed-wasserstein-barycenter-generateviz.ipynb), [step 3](https://github.com/cbaldassari/manifold/blob/main/manifold-informed-wasserstein-barycenter-wassgmmcalibration.ipynb) containing the code to implement the method we propose in the paper and covers all the steps of the following analytic workflow, divided in two steps:
